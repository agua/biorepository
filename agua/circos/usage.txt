  *** CIRCOS ERROR ***

  CONFIGURATION FILE ERROR

  Circos could not find the configuration file. To run Circos, you need to
  specify this file using the -conf flag. The configuration file contains all
  the parameters that define the image, including input files, image size,
  formatting, etc.

  If you do not use the -conf flag, Circos will attempt to look for a file
  circos.conf in several reasonable places such as . etc/ ../etc

  To see how configuration files work, create the example image, whose
  configuration and data are found in example/. From the Circos distribution
  directory,

      cd example

      ../bin/circos -conf ./circos.conf

  or use the 'run' script (UNIX only).

  Configuration files are described here

  and the use of command-line flags, such as -conf, is described here
