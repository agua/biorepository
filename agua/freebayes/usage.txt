Bayesian small polymorphism discovery.

parameters:

   -h --help       Prints this help dialog.

input and output:

   -b --bam FILE   Add FILE to the set of BAM files to be analyzed.
   -c --stdin      Read BAM input on stdin.
   -v --vcf FILE   Output VCF-format results to FILE.
   -f --fasta-reference FILE
                   Use FILE as the reference sequence for analysis.
                   An index file (FILE.fai) will be created if none exists.
                   If neither --targets nor --region are specified, FreeBayes
                   will analyze every position in this reference.
   -t --targets FILE
                   Limit analysis to targets listed in the BED-format FILE.
   -r --region <chrom>:<start_position>..<end_position>
                   Limit analysis to the specified region, 0-base coordinates,
                   end_position not included (same as BED format).
   -s --samples FILE
                   Limit analysis to samples listed (one per line) in the FILE.
                   By default FreeBayes will analyze all samples in its input
                   BAM files.
   --populations FILE
                   Each line of FILE should list a sample and a population which
                   it is part of.  The population-based bayesian inference model
                   will then be partitioned on the basis of the populations.
   -A --cnv-map FILE
                   Read a copy number map from the BED file FILE, which has
                   the format:
                      reference sequence, start, end, sample name, copy number
                   ... for each region in each sample which does not have the
                   default copy number as set by --ploidy.
   -L --trace FILE  Output an algorithmic trace to FILE.
   --failed-alleles FILE
                   Write a BED file of the analyzed positions which do not
                   pass --pvar to FILE.
   -@ --variant-input VCF
                   Use variants reported in VCF file as input to the algorithm.
                   Variants in this file will be treated as putative variants
                   even if there is not enough support in the data to pass
                   input filters.
   -l --only-use-input-alleles
                   Only provide variant calls and genotype likelihoods for sites
                   and alleles which are provided in the VCF input, and provide
                   output in the VCF for all input alleles, not just those which
                   have support in the data.
   --haplotype-basis-alleles VCF
                   When specified, only variant alleles provided in this input
                   VCF will be used for the construction of complex or haplotype
                   alleles.
   --report-all-haplotype-alleles
                   At sites where genotypes are made over haplotype alleles,

                   those which are called.

                   at the site is greater than N.  default: 0.0001

                   genotype likelihood for the sample.  default: ~unbounded
   -j --use-mapping-quality
                   Use mapping quality of alleles when calculating data likelihoods.
   -D --read-dependence-factor N
                   Incorporate non-independence of reads by scaling successive
                   observations by this factor during data likelihood
                   calculations.  default: 0.9
   -= --no-marginals
                   Do not calculate the marginal probability of genotypes.  Saves
                   time and improves scaling performance in large populations.
