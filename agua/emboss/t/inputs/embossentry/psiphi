Version: EMBOSS:6.4.0.0

   Standard (Mandatory) qualifiers:
  [-infile]            infile     Clean protein structure coordinates file
   -chainnumber        integer    [1] Number of the chain for which torsion
                                  angles should be calculated (Integer 1 or
                                  more)
   -startresiduenumber integer    [1] First residue in chain for which torsion
                                  angles should be calculated (Integer 1 or
                                  more)
   -finishresiduenumber integer    [1] Last residue in chain for which torsion
                                  angles should be calculated (1 = last
                                  residue) (Any integer value)
