merge_variants merges the variants from multiple gVCF files

version: v0.16.2

usage: merge_variants [options] > merged_variants

options:

configuration:
  --ref arg             samtools reference sequence (required)
  --region arg          samtools reference region (optional)
  --exclude arg         name of chromosome to skip over (argument may be
                        specified multiple times). Exclusions will be ignored
                        if a region argument is provided
  --input arg           merge files (can be specified multiple times)
  --murdock             If true, don't stop because of any out-of-order
                        position conflicts. Any out of order positions are
                        ignored. In case of an overlap the first observation is
                        used and subsequent repeats are ignored.

Note this is a simple prototype merge implementation and comes with
considerable restrictions:

  - Most INFO fields are not recomputed/forwared to the merged record.
  - Most sample fields are not forwarded to the merged record (this would
      require knowing which fields depend on allele count.)
  - Merged record FILTER field is a simple union of all merged samples,
      thus a single filtered sample will filter the merged record.
  - No handling of overlapping indel alleles
