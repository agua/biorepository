#./fasta_formatter -h
usage: fasta_formatter [-h] [-i INFILE] [-o OUTFILE] [-w N] [-t] [-e]
Part of FASTX Toolkit 0.0.12 by gordon@cshl.edu

   [-h]         = This helpful help screen.
   [-i INFILE]  = FASTA/Q input file. default is STDIN.
   [-o OUTFILE] = FASTA/Q output file. default is STDOUT.
   [-w N]       = max. sequence line width for output FASTA file.
                  When ZERO (the default), sequence lines will NOT be wrapped -
                  all nucleotides of each sequences will appear on a single 
                  line (good for scripting).
   [-t]         = Output tabulated format (instead of FASTA format).
                  Sequence-Identifiers will be on first column,
                  Nucleotides will appear on second column (as single line).
   [-e]         = Output empty sequences (default is to discard them).
                  Empty sequences are ones who have only a sequence identifier,
                  but not actual nucleotides.

Input Example:
   >MY-ID
   AAAAAGGGGG
   CCCCCTTTTT
   AGCTN

Output example with unlimited line width [-w 0]:
   >MY-ID
   AAAAAGGGGGCCCCCTTTTTAGCTN

Output example with max. line width=7 [-w 7]:
   >MY-ID
   AAAAAGG
   GGGTTTT
   TCCCCCA
   GCTN

Output example with tabular output [-t]:
   MY-ID	AAAAAGGGGGCCCCCTTTTAGCTN

example of empty sequence:
(will be discarded unless [-e] is used)
  >REGULAR-SEQUENCE-1
  AAAGGGTTTCCC
  >EMPTY-SEQUENCE
  >REGULAR-SEQUENCE-2
  AAGTAGTAGTAGTAGT
  GTATTTTATAT
